# omr-dataset

Inspired by the example of famous [MNIST][1] (60000 labelled images of manual Zip code), we have a similar vision of a well-known and representative data set to help the development of applications in the specific domain of Optical Music Recognition.

Such reference data could serve as:
+ Ground-truth material for evaluating or comparing OMR engines
+ OMR samples for the training and testing of a symbol classifier

Ultimately, once the structuring and content of this data is sufficiently validated, we think this reference should be hosted by the International Music Score Library Project ([IMSLP][2]). 
Meanwhile, the purpose of this "omr-dataset" Github repository is to gather the early material used to build preliminary versions of the target reference.

See the related [wiki][3] for more details.
