# omr-dataset

## Vision

Inspired by the famous example of [MNIST][1] public database (60000 labelled images of hand-written digits), we acknowledge the need for a well-known and representative data set to help the development of applications in the specific domain of Optical Music Recognition.

## Purpose

+ OMR samples for the training and testing of a symbol classifier
+ Ground-truth material for evaluating or comparing OMR engines

## Organization

Ultimately, once data structuring and content is sufficiently validated, we think this reference should preferably be hosted by the International Music Score Library Project ([IMSLP][2]). 

Meanwhile, the purpose of this `omr-dataset` Github repository is to gather the material used to build preliminary versions of the target reference.

## Development

See the related [wiki][3] for more details.
