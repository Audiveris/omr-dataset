# omr-dataset

Inspired by the famous MNIST example (60000 labelled images of manual Zip code), we acknowledge the need for a similar well-known and representative data set to help the development of applications in the specific domain of Optical Music Recognition.

Such reference data could serve as:
+ Ground-truth material for evaluating or comparing OMR engines
+ OMR symbols data set for the training and testing of a symbol classifier

Ultimately, once the structuring and content of this data is sufficiently validated, we think this reference should be hosted by the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP). 
Meanwhile, the purpose of this "omr-dataset" Github repository is to gather the early material used to build preliminary versions of the target data set.

See the related wiki for more details about this work.
